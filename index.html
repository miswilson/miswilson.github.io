            <h2>Section 1: Exploring Scatter Charts</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                The scatter plot below visualises the relationship between GDP per capita (on a logarithmic scale) and life expectancy, across different regions of the world. The x-axis presents GDP per capita (PPP, international $), whilst the y-axis illustrates life expectancy in years.

        <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
            Each point represents a country - by region coded by colour - and the size of the points reflects population size. The data follows the general trend that wealthier countries have better health outcomes, as indicated by higher life expectancies. By eye, countries in Africa are concentrated in the ranges with lower GDP and life expectancy, whilst Europe and parts of Oceania are more concentrated in the upper, right hand region of the chart. This demonstrates the correlation between higher GDP and life expectancy.      </p>

            <h2>Section 2: Exploring Bar Charts</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                Using a bar chart can be useful to illustrate quantative data and its position attributes. The following bar chart illustrates GDP per capita by country. With countries on the x-axis and GDP per capita on the y-axis, the viewer can compare living standards across countries.

        </div>
        <figure id="Location2"></figure> <!-- we give it an id so we can put a vega-lite graph here with VegaEmbed -->
        <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
            The chart contends that GDP per capita in the USA is highest; its GDP per capita, close to $75,000, followed by the UK with over $50,000. The DR Congo displays the lowest GDP per capita, being a low of approximately $1,000. This contends to the sever disparity in living standards across regions. This stark difference highlights the severe global economic inequality and disparity in living standards between developed nations and developing regions, reinforcing how unevenly wealth is distributed globally.       </p>

            <h2>Section 3: Exploring Line Charts</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                This line chart effectively illustrates the widening global economic disparities, using PPP rates of Real GDP per Capita ($) from 1990 to 2022. Across the six countries it can be seen that the rapid rise of China stands out.

        <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
            The data reads that the US and UK show consistently high GDP per capita, with the UK experiencing sharper growth after 2015, reaching around $70,000 in 2022. China follows a more significant growth trajectory, especially after 2005, rising sharply to over $20,000 by 2022. India, Nigeria, and Congo remain much lower in comparison, though all three exhibit gradual upward trends. The gap between more developed economies (US, UK) and developing countries (Congo, Nigeria, India) remains substantial throughout the period.        </p>

            The data reads a bar chart displaying the inflation rate in Japan, measured by CPI (%), from 1960 to 2020. This chart highlights Japanâ€™s transition from high post-war inflation to a prolonged period of price stability and deflation, reflecting broader economic changes. Inflation peaked at over 20% in 1974 during the global oil crisis. Since the 1980s, inflation has drastically decreased, with very low levels through the 1990s and 2000s, with some periods of deflation (negative inflation).

            <h2>Section 5: My visualisation 2 - Economics Observatory Hub</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                This is my 2nd visualisation using the Economics Observatory Data Hub. I had to use code to layer the data from Economics Observatory on renewables in France and the United Kingdom. This line graph compares the renewable energy output (in GWh) for France (shown in blue) and the United Kingdom (red) from the 1970s to 2021.

        <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
            Key observations from the data are that France had a significantly higher renewable energy output from 1970 to around 2010, with fluctuations between 40,000 and 80,000 GWh over this period. The red line illustrates UK renewable energy output to have had a sharp increase in 2010, surpassing France by 2020, peaking at over 120,000 GWh. Both countries experience fluctuations, with recent data showing a slight dip after peaking. Overall, renewable energy output in France exceeded that of the UK, from 2015 onwards UK renewable output overtook France, which had an earlier and more stable trajectory.
